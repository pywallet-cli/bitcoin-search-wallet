Recover Private Keys From Deleted Wallet Files
====================

In this guide we will use scalpel and a custom ruby script and gem to recover lost private keys from deleted wallet files. The first step when deciding to attempt to recover private keys from a lost wallet file is to determine which public addresses holds the coins you are interested in recovering. Once you determine this you can then attempt to extract all the private keys on a drive iterate through each private key, compute the public key and determine it if is the key you are looking for.

Donations

I created this to help others and I believe in free open source code so I don't expect to be paid, but if you are able to recover funds and are feeling generous, I accept donations. 

I lost 0.24 bitcoins and unfortunately was not able to recover them, and my significant other 20 lost I gifted to them in aencrypted wallet. 

I was able to recover 10,000 lost Darkcoins using this method though and was grateful it worked and wanted to share my methods with others.
